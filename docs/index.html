  <h1>Golden Gate Group Investments LLC</h1>
  <p><strong>Long-term real estate investing, grounded in integrity.</strong></p>
  <p>Founded in March 2024, Golden Gate Group Investments acquires and manages residential rental properties across Texas and Ohio.</p>
  <p>Our portfolio has been built using conventional financing and refinancing — but always with a disciplined, long-term approach. We aim to steward capital, not chase yield.</p>
  <p>As our conviction in Bitcoin and sound money deepens, we're actively exploring:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transitioning toward equity-based models</li>
    <li>Integrating a Bitcoin treasury strategy</li>
    <li>Building a more transparent, resilient foundation for future investing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We believe in doing the hard work behind the numbers — and aligning investment practices with enduring values.</p>
